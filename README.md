# Discord Bot: Aki 

This is my first Discord Bot called **Aki**. The main idea behind it is to learn bot-programming in **.NET C#**. It does not have many functions yet but I am trying to do my best in further improving it.

It is currently **not possible** to invite it to your server because it is still in early development. Therefore it would cause too many problems that may not even be discovered yet.

With Update **1.19.0.0**, the bot is now online on my discord server. **(German)**: https://discord.gg/H4Csk66
