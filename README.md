# Discord Bot: Aki 

This is my first Discord Bot called **Aki**. The main idea behind it is to learn bot-programming in **.NET C#** and also to add it to my own server at some time in the future. It does not have many functions yet but I am trying to do my best in further improving it.

It is currently **not possible** to invite it to your server because it is still in early development. Therefore it would cause too many problems that may not even be discovered yet.

## Features

Following features are available **at the moment**:

 - Moderation: Filtering black listed words in german and english
	 - There are two files already included
	 - Later it will be possible to add your own words
 - "Useful" Commands: kicking, banning, etc.
 - "Fun" Commands: Hugs, Pats and more
 
## Roadmap
 
 - making it multi-server compatible
 - making the bot available for everyone
 - adding more feature for every section:
	 - moderation
	 - administration
	 - fun
